## A brief tutorial.

After installing the package, import all necessary functions.

```python
from docintegrity.core import find_duplicates
from docintegrity.utils import get_file_list, print_file_list
```

Then specify the folder that contains the docx files. Optionally, add a output folder where the results will be stores as a csv.

```python
example_path = "examples/docx"
example_output= "examples"
```

For demonstration purposes, I use 8 essays on physics and computer science generated by ChatGPT. A few sentences were copied between the documents.

```python
file_list = get_file_list(example_path)
print_file_list(file_list)
```

```
File 1: ../examples/docx/The Role of Symmetry in Physics From Noether's Theorem to the Standard Model.docx
File 2: ../examples/docx/The Future of Energy Advances in Nuclear Fusion Research.docx
File 3: ../examples/docx/The Future of Quantum Computing A Paradigm Shift in Information Processing.docx
File 4: ../examples/docx/The Quantum Mechanics Revolution Understanding the Weird World of Subatomic Particles.docx
File 5: ../examples/docx/Computational Complexity Theory Unraveling the Fabric of Efficient Computation.docx
File 6: ../examples/docx/Emergence and Complexity Exploring Physics Beyond Reductionism.docx
File 7: ../examples/docx/Automata Theory and Formal Languages A Comprehensive Exploration.docx
File 8: ../examples/docx/The Search for Dark Matter Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe.docx
```

Now let's run the primary function. 

```
duplicates = find_duplicates(example_path)
duplicates.head()
```
